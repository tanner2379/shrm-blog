  The basis of our faith is the Bible, which is uniquely inspired, without error, and is our only rule of faith and practice.
  As the Bible teaches, there is one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three persons;
  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

export const statementOfFaithP2 = `This infinite God created human beings to be in and have fellowship with Him, but by their own choice they have sinfully gone their own way. 
  The result is we are alienated and cut off from God and are in need of God's saving grace to end this alienation.
  Salvation comes only through God's grace, not human effort, and must be received personally by repentance and faith.\n\n
  God has extended this saving grace to us in the person of Jesus Christ whose sinless life and death on the cross paid for our sin
  as He willingly became our substitute. This salvation is given only to those who have a change of mind and heart toward God and put their trust
  in Christ alone. Jesus Christ lives today, having been raised from the dead and is the only mediator between us and God.
  He will return to earth to consummate history.

  glorify God and serve those in need. At the end, everyone will experience bodily resurrection and judgement. Only believers will have eternal
